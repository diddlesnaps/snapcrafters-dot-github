## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are a community of people who maintain snaps of applications that are not our own. Our goal is to be a trusted and reliable source for high-quality snaps. All snaps from the "Snapcrafters" publisher in the Snap Store are maintained by us. We also help create tooling and documentation to help others create better snap packages.

- Similar to traditional distributions, we use formal processes to maintain snaps so that updates are tested and high-quality before they reach users.
- We share maintenance workload over multiple people so there isn't a single point of failure.
- We share knowledge and work on tooling to improve the quality of the whole Snap ecosystem.
- We vet contributors before they get publishing rights.
- We work with the upstream application developers to transfer snap ownership to them when they are interested in taking over maintenance.

Having the upstream application developer maintain and publish a snap for their application is preferred but not always possible. If the developers are not yet interested in maintaining the snap, we fill the gap.

## Who is part of it?

Our formal community is split into three groups:

- **"Regular members"** contribute to the snaps and are part of our Telegram channel.
- **"Core members"** develop and maintain the snaps and lead this group. All core members are listed in the ["Reviewers" team](https://github.com/orgs/snapcrafters/teams/reviewers) of this organization.
- **"Administrators"** manage this GitHub organization and the "Snapcrafters" account in the Snap Store.

## How to contribute

Anyone can contribute to our snaps and toolkits. Just create a PR and tag `@reviewers` to ask us to review your contribution.
